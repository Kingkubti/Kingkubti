# Hey there! I'm kubti

I'm  a multidisciplinary artist who explores the raw emotions that shape our lives, moments of light, darkness, and everything in between.  My art mostly focuses on the day-to-day experiences, the good, bad and the ones we are yet to decipher, all shaped as beings, and most accommodated with poetry, i create to express, express what the silent heart could barely speak  

### What I'm working on  
- Crafting unique, meaningful 1/1 fine art pieces.  
- Learning Python to merge creativity with technology.  
- Writing poetry that speaks to the soul.
